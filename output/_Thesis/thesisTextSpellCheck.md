Differential Equations are fundamental in scientific disciplines for modelling real-world dynamic processes and their temporal evolution. The approach usually involves integrating the differential, a small change with respect to some continuous variable, of an unknown function and their derivatives over a small change in the underlying state.\\ \\ 
As a principle, this makes sense; for instance, the change in population size can be modelled by observing the birth and death rates over a specific time interval. Subsequent steps involve integrating this equation, either analytically or numerically, with respect to a variable, often but not always time $t$. The solution is presented as a vector field allowing inference of the state of the underlying process at a given time for specified initial conditions.\\ \\ 
This enabled scientists to predict physical, chemical and biological processes that were challenging or impossible to model. Nevertheless, traditional Differential Equations exhibit limiations when used to model complex systems with high dimensional data, non-linearity or uncertain dynamics, such as the weather, stock markets or other systems undergoing noise or disturbances.\\ \\
These limitations have hindered the application of Differential Equations within the realm of machine learning, where function parameters are often not given explicitly but are instead embedded within large volumes of data. \cite{chen_neural_2018} extend the concept of Differential Equations with Neural Networks, innovatively introducing \nodes to the fields of Machine Learning (ML) and RL.
